Our task is to take these inputs, parse the file and come up with .sdc file, and also give out the the datasheet like a characteristics of the input .csv provided.

Languages used - tcsh and TCL

Post .sdc file, we run synthesis and timing using opensource tool like yosys and openTimer. Final is the preLayout timing results which would be our requirement. 
Further details of the steps and lab outputs are recorded in each corresponding day. Feel free to checkout.
