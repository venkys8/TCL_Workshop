- Begin by creating variables out of rows and columns in CSV file

- Checks for paths provided if they exist or not, else break the script, prompt the user 

- if you cat *.csv in the terminal, it will be listed contents separated by ",". "," will be used to process (as a channel seaprator)

- [file normalize $m_arr(1,$i)]. $m_arr(1,$i) represents a file/path. After file normalize we get absolute path. '~'/ extra variables get removed

* Sample outputs for script ( script is updated continuosly over a period of 5 days)
